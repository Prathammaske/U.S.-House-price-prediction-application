# U.S.-House-price-prediction-application
The U.S. House Price Prediction project forecasts the Case-Shiller Index (CSUSHPISA) using economic indicators like GDP and interest rates. Built with Flask, it provides real-time predictions, interactive visualizations, and scenario analysis, helping users understand housing trends and make informed decisions.
Project Highlights
Objective: Predict the CSUSHPISA value based on user-provided economic indicators.
Methodology: The project uses a machine learning model trained on historical data to establish a relationship between the economic indicators and the target variable, CSUSHPISA.
User Interaction: A user-friendly web interface allows users to input economic indicators, view predictions, and explore insights.
Features
Economic Indicator Input:

Users provide data such as GDP, interest rates, unemployment rates, inflation, and other relevant economic variables.
The project includes a preprocessing pipeline to handle user inputs.
Predictive Modeling:

The project employs machine learning algorithms to predict the CSUSHPISA index.
Models are trained and validated to ensure robust performance.
Web Deployment:

Built with Flask, the web application allows users to interact with the model in real time.
Input forms capture user data, which is processed and sent to the backend for prediction.
Interactive Visualizations:

Users can explore trends and relationships between economic indicators and housing prices.
Visual dashboards provide additional insights into market dynamics.
Additional Features (Planned or Implemented):

Area-specific predictions to refine insights based on regional data.
Economic news integration to highlight recent developments affecting housing prices.
A batch prediction feature for custom dataset uploads.
Forecasting and scenario analysis to assess future trends under different economic conditions.
Technology Stack
Programming Language: Python
Frameworks: Flask (for web development)
Visualization Libraries: Matplotlib, Seaborn, or Plotly
Machine Learning Libraries: Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy
Deployment: Flask-based website for user interaction.
Use Cases
Real Estate Analysts: Gain insights into housing trends for investment decisions.
Policy Makers: Evaluate the impact of economic changes on the housing market.
